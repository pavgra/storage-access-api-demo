# storage-access-api-demo

## Research result

The following was confirmed:
> If the user has interacted with the embedded site in first-party context in the last 30 days of Safari use, and the site has cookies set, the site can call the Storage Access API upon a user interaction in the embed (such as a click or tap), after which Safari will prompt the user if they want to allow the embedded site to access its storage.
